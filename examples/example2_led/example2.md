[Python Code: example2_led.py](example2_led.py)

#To run:
- Edit example2_led.py to put the location of your "pin" inside of your minecraft world
- run example2_led.py


If everything worked then you should be able to flip the switch in the minecraft world and have LED1 on the espruino turn on/off when you do.
